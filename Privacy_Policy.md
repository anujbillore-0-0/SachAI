## 1. Data Controller

The sachAI Extension is provided by [Your Name/Company Name, e.g., Anuj Billore].
Contact: [Your Email Address, e.g., anuj.billore@example.com]

## 2. What Information We Collect

The sachAI Extension's primary function is to fact-check user-selected text. To achieve this, the Extension collects the following information:

- **User-Selected Text (Website Content / Personal Communications):** When you highlight text on a webpage and initiate the fact-checking process via the Extension's interface or context menu, the selected text is temporarily collected. This is the only user-generated content the Extension processes.

**We do NOT collect:**

- Any personally identifiable information (e.g., your name, email address, IP address beyond what is necessary for API communication).
- Your browsing history or any web page content you have not explicitly selected.
- Financial, health, or authentication information.
- Your precise location.
- Any background user activity (e.g., clicks, scrolls, keystrokes).

## 3. How We Use and Share Information

The user-selected text is used for the **sole purpose of providing fact-checking services**. This process involves:

- **Sending to AI Services:** The selected text is securely transmitted to third-party Artificial Intelligence (AI) and search services. These services, such as Groq (for AI model inference) and Tavily (for web search and evidence gathering), process the text to:
    - Extract verifiable claims.
    - Craft search queries to find supporting or refuting evidence.
    - Evaluate the gathered evidence.
- **Generating a Fact-Check Report:** The results from these AI services are compiled into a fact-check report, which is then displayed to you within the Extension's interface.

**Data Sharing:**
We share your user-selected text only with the necessary third-party AI and search service providers (e.g., Groq, Tavily) to perform the fact-checking service. These providers are bound by their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review them.

**We do NOT sell or transfer your data to third parties for purposes unrelated to the Extension's single purpose.We do NOT use or transfer your data for creditworthiness or lending purposes.**

## 4. Data Retention

The user-selected text is processed in real-time. We **do not store** the user-submitted text on our servers after the fact-checking analysis is complete and the report has been generated. The text is ephemeral and only exists for the duration of the fact-checking request.

## 5. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the information transmitted to and from the Extension. Data is transmitted securely using standard encryption protocols.

## 6. Your Consent

By installing and using the sachAI Extension, you consent to the collection and use of information as described in this Privacy Policy.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy


We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
